MySqlLiteHelper helps us to create and upgrade the databases, and its parent SQLiteOpenHelper takes care of all
database management activities.

AndroidDataSource is the data access object.( i see it as exposed API )
- this uses the MySqlLiteHelper to create the database
- gives API to open , insertRow, deleteRow , getAll,  close the db
- ContentValues are key-value pairs for insertion


Comment is our row model data structure


TestDatabaseActivity is main activity class
- uses List Activity for displaying data.
- uses layout database.xml
-  wasn't able to update the db , but entries were going fine

database.xml is layout file
